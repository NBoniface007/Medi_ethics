Smart Garden AI

Final project for the Building AI course

Summary

An AI-powered system to help home gardeners optimize plant growth by predicting watering, sunlight, and fertilization needs. Building AI course project.

Background

Many home gardeners struggle to provide plants with the right care, leading to stunted growth or plant loss.

Problem 1: Over- or under-watering common in home gardening.

Problem 2: Lack of real-time insights about sunlight exposure and soil conditions.

Personal motivation: I enjoy gardening and want to make plant care easier and data-driven.

Importance: Could save resources (water, fertilizer) and improve plant survival.

How is it used?

Users place small IoT sensors in the garden to measure soil moisture, sunlight, and temperature.
The AI system collects this data and provides daily recommendations via a mobile app:

When to water

Amount of fertilizer to add

Ideal sunlight exposure

Data sources and AI methods

Data sources:

Soil moisture, temperature, light intensity from sensors

Historical plant growth datasets

AI methods:

Regression models to predict plant growth

Time-series forecasting for watering schedules

Optional: Reinforcement learning to optimize care over time

Syntax	Description
Sensors	Provide real-time data about soil and environment
Mobile App	Provides user-friendly advice to gardeners
AI Model	Predicts optimal plant care recommendations
Challenges

Model accuracy depends on sensor quality.

Cannot account for all plant species or unexpected weather changes.

Ethical considerations: users may rely too heavily on AI, neglecting their own observation.

What next?

Expand to support more plant species.

Integrate weather forecasts for outdoor gardens.

Add plant disease detection via image recognition.

Collaborate with IoT manufacturers and gardening communities.
